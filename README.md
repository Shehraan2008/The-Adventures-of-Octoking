To play Octogram on your broswer, visit this [website](https://tempest2121.github.io/The-Adventures-of-Octoking/) and make sure your device is in landscape mode.

Octogram works best when given a certain resolution. I suggest a resolution excedding 1400x900. If your device does not meets the follwing reqirment you might adjust the zoom of the page according to your liking.

Thatâ€™s all it takes! Octogram is now set up in your browser and your players can begin battling each other and collecting new characters.
